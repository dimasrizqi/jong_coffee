## Installation:
1. Clone this project and install PHP (if haven't already).
2. Run `php artisan serve` to startup the server locally.


### To create dummy data:
This step is not needed unless you need extra fresh dummy data. Assuming all tables are empty except for user table:
1. `Menu::factory()->times(20)->create();`
2. Create some discount vouchers (Can program a DiscountFactory if necessary)
3. `Transaction::factory()->times(50)->create();` - This will create 50 order instances too
4. `CartItem::factory()->times(150)->create();` - Each cart will be assigned to 1 of the orders made above
5. Open up your *artisan tinker* and execute:
    ```php
    $transactions = Transaction::all();
    foreach ($transactions as $t) {
        $t->final_amount = $t->order->getTotalFromScratch();
        $t->save();
    }
